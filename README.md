CRYSTALS COLLECTOR:

Time for some quick math memory!  How quickly can you add?  Let's go see with this app.  Here's how it works:

There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
You will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

When you click on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

The game will hide this amount until you click a crystal.
When you do click one, your score counter will be updated.

You win if your total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
You lose if your score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever you wins or loses.

When the game begins again, you will see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, your score (and score counter) will reset to zero.


The app shows the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
